Java:
	*Java is a high level, object oriented programming language and platform widely used for build applications
	*It was first developed by sun Microsystems in 1995 now maintained by oracle corporation 
	*Java is designed by platform independent, which means that program write once can run on any devices or systems
	with the help of JVM , This concept is know as WORA.

JVM, JRE, JDK: 
	*JVM (Java Virtual Machine): Runs Java bytecode on any platform.
	*JRE (Java Runtime Environment): Provides libraries and JVM for running Java applications.
	*JDK (Java Development Kit): Includes JRE and development tools for building Java applications.


Variables:
	*In java variable is a container that holds a data
	*A variable is a memory location name for the data
	*Types of Variables in java---> Local, Instance, Static, Parameter
	*Local: Local variable defined within a body of a method or constructor is called a local variable
	*Instance: Instance variable is a non-static variable and are declared in a class but outside of any method within a class body or constructor
	*Static: Static variable is also know as class variable and are declared in a class but outside of the any method

Data Type in java:
	*In java, a data type specifices the kind of data that can be stored and manipulated within a program
	*Java has two categories of DataTypes :  Primitive and Non-Primitive Data Type	
	* (Data types in Java specify the size and type of values that can be stored in a variable)
	
	
Methods:
	*In java methods is a collection of statements that perform some specific task
	*It’s a set of codes that perform a particular task
	*syntax of method: Access_specifier returnType and methodName(){ // body}
	
Class: 
		*Class is a templete or blue print for creating objects
		*Class is a group of object
		*A class can contain >variable >methods >Constructor >Blocks

Wrapper class:
		*Wrapper class is a class
		*Wrapper class is used to converting a primitive data types into objects
		*Sometimes you need to treat a primitive data types as object, So wrapper class is allows that
			
Arrays:
		*Arrays in java are container that hold a fixed number of values of a single type.
		*They are used to store multiple values in a single variable.	
					
java principles

constructor : 
	*In java, Constructor is a special method, that is used to initilize a object, 
	*It has a same name as the class and does not have a return  type, Constructor is a block of code similay like a method,
	*At the time of calling Constructor memory of object allocated in memory
	*Constructor has a two types : Default, Parameterized
	*Constructor cannot be abstract, static and final 
	*We cannot overRide a constructor
	*But we can over load a constructor
	
Constructor chaining:
		*Constructor chaining in Java is a  constructor calls another constructor in the same class or in its superclass
		*A constructor calls another constructor in the same class using this() keyword.
		*A constructor calls a constructor in the superclass using super() keyword.
	
static block :
	*In java static block is know as static initilize block
	*Is a block of code runs only once
	*It’s used to initialize static variables
	*static block helps to execute without main() method the java program, 
	it's support only JDK1.6 or previous of 1.6 now it's throw error.
	
class block
static import:
	*In java static import is allows you to access static members of class directly without qualify with class name 
	* static import is introduced in java 5.
	
wild card import

== and equals():

	* == Operator: Compares object references. Use it to check if two references point to the same object.
	* Checks if two references point to the same object in memory.
	
	* equals() Method: Compares the content of objects. Override it in your class to define logical equality based on your requirements.
	* Checks if two objects are logically equal based on their state (content).

equals method:
	*The equals() method in Java is used to compare two objects for equality. 
	*By default , the equals() method is provided by the object class
	*compare the content of the object
	
toString method:
	*toString() method in java is used to provide a string representation of a object.
	*By default, toString method from object.	
	*a class returns a string consting of class name follewed by @ and  object hashCode in hexadecimal 
	*this not very informative, So if overriden the method to provide meaningful output.

hashCode method:
	*The hashCode() method in Java is used to generate a unique code (hash code) for an object.
	* This code is a 32-bit signed integer that can be used for efficiently managing collections of objects
	
Exception----> checked , Un checked
	*An exception in java is an event it's disrupts the normal flow of a program.
	*it's a object represents an error and unexcepted event, During the execution of a program
	*Exceptions are used to error handiling in java.
	* Exception handling using try, catch and finally block to manage exception
	* All exception are subclasses of Trowable its a java.lang package
	
	
	
try() catch() finally():	

try Block:
	*Contains code that might throw an exception.
	*If an exception occurs, the rest of the try block is skipped, and control goes to the matching catch block.

catch Block:
	*Catches and handles the exception thrown in the try block.
	*Multiple catch blocks can be used to handle different types of exceptions.

finally Block:
	*Always executes, regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not.
	*Used for cleanup activities like closing resources
	
method overriding, method over loading
Access specifier
final keyword
abstract class , Interfaces

Enum:
	* An enum is a special class 
	*That represent group of constants(Unchangable variables, like a final variable)
	*To create a enum, Use the enum keyword
	*Constants should be in uppercase.
	*Enums are prefect for where you need pre-defined set of constants.

String:
	* In Java, a String is a sequence of characters used to represent textual data. 
	*Strings are objects that are immutable, meaning once a String object is created, its value cannot be changed. 
	*This immutability helps ensure that string values remain consistent and secure.	
	
StringBuffer:
	*StringBuffer class in java used to create mutable Strings. unlike the String class is immutable
	*StringBuffers allows you to modify the content of the string without creating a new object.	
	
Collection
 D/w List and Set:
	* List:
			* Maintain Insertioin order
			*Allows duplicate elements
			*Provides index access to elements 
			*Impl- ArrayList, LinkedList
	* Set:
			* Does not maintain Insertioin order
			* Does not allow duplicates elements
			* Does not provide index access to elements
			* Impl- HashSet, LinkedHashSet
